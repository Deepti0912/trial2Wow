Box Site Automation Framework 
https://www.box.com
Box site provides secure content management and file sharing facilities
========================================================================
## Scope of this Project

1. Automate login functionality with happy and unhappy login path
2. User with valid login credentials able to create a new folder on the site
3. User with valid login credentials able to upload a file within the folder on the site
========================================================================
## Tools and Technologies ##

   Java            # Programming Language
   Cucumber        # BDD
   pom.xml         # Maven project build definition, Maven dependencies 
   
 ========================================================================
 ## Prerequisites  ##  
 * Install Java8, Maven and IDE of choice (Intellij)
 * Add Cucumber with Java and Gherkin plugins to IDE
 * Save **test.png** file at **C:/temp** folder. This file will be used to upload to the Box site

========================================================================

========================================================================
## Steps for Execution ##

* Unzip the project file and open it in Intellij
* To run the tests, right click on the feature file under the resources folder
